#wd: Working Directory. Unless an absolute path, global option file locations and server working directories (unless manually specified) are assumed to be relative to this folder.
#If started as root, this MUST be specified.
wd=/opt/mcstarter
#log: log file location for the main program (not the mincraft server instances)
log=MCStarter.log
#status: status file location.
status=mcstatus
#stop: global stop file. (If file is present, all servers will stop and will restart when the file is deleted).

#watchConf: If true, the config file will be watched for changes. When changes are made, all servers are stopped, the new conf is processed, then servers are restarted.
#Defaults to true.
